### Hi there, I am Brandon Rivera 👋🏻

## I'm a young, ambitious, and hard working developer.

- I am currently working on developing this portfolio to help showcase what I have learned about web development.
- ⏳ This is a work in progress so please don't expect much.
- 👀 Please feel free to take a look at how it's coming along.
- 👨🏼‍💻 I am currently learning anything and everything I can.
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Collaborate on open source projects and be more active in development community.
- ⚡️ Fun Fact: I also like working with the Unity Game Engine outside of web development.
